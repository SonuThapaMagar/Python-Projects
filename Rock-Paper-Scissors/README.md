#Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This project implements a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using object-oriented programming principles. Before proceeding, it's recommended to have a good understanding of objects and classes.

#How the Game Works
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:
-Rock: Represented by a closed fist.
-Paper: Represented by an open hand.
-Scissors: Represented by a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V.

#Rules:
-If both players choose the same shape, the game is a draw.
-If the players choose different shapes, the winner is determined by the following rules:
-Rock crushes Scissors.
-Paper covers Rock.
-Scissors cuts Paper.

#Project Description
This project simulates a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between a user and the computer.

#How It Works:
-The computer randomly selects one of the three shapes: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
-The user is prompted to choose one of the shapes.
-The game then compares the computer's choice with the user's choice.
-Based on the comparison, the game will declare the outcome as either a win, loss, or draw for the user.
