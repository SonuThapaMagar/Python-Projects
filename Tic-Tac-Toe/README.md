Tic Tac Toe Game in Python
Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python. The game can be played in the terminal, where two players take turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid with either an 'X' or an 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode (local)
- Simple text-based user interface
- Input validation to prevent overwriting moves
- Automatic detection of win/loss/draw conditions


## How is tic-tac-toe played?

The game is played between two players on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
If a player decides to select X, the other player will take O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a straight row wins.
If all the 9 squares are full but none of the players can get 3 of their marks in a row, it's a draw.
